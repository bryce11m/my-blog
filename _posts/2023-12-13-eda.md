# Introduction
Basketball is not just a sport; it's a dynamic, fast-paced game that involves skill, strategy, and teamwork. In this analysis, we delve into the world of basketball player statistics, exploring a dataset that combines information on player demographics, performance metrics, and shooting preferences.

# Motivation and Research Question
Understanding player statistics is crucial for teams, coaches, and fans alike. How has shooting and efficiency changed over the years? How do shooting preferences vary among different positions? We aim to answer these questions and gain insights into the dynamics of basketball player performance.

# Data Collection and Cleaning
To conduct this analysis, we collected data from Basketball Reference, focusing on the Atlanta Hawks team. We merged two datasets, one containing player data and another detailing player positions and shooting preferences. After cleaning and merging the data, we created a comprehensive dataset for exploration.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Count of Players in Each Position
The bar chart below illustrates the distribution of players across different positions in the Atlanta Hawks team. It provides a snapshot of the team's composition.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Assuming 'merged_df' is the merged DataFrame
# Modify column names based on your actual data

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
ax = sns.countplot(x='position', data=merged_df)
plt.title('Count of Players in Each Position')
plt.xlabel('Position')
plt.ylabel('Count')

# Rotate x-labels for better readability
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha='right')

plt.show()
```

2. Distribution of Players' Shooting Preferences
The pie chart below visualizes the distribution of players' shooting preferences. It offers insights into the prevalence of right- and left-handed shooters.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
merged_df['shoots'].value_counts().plot.pie(autopct='%1.1f%%')
plt.title('Distribution of Players\' Shooting Preferences')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()
```

3. Distribution of Players' Shooting Percentages by Position
We explore the shooting percentages of players in various positions through a box plot. This visualization allows us to identify variations in shooting performance.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

merged_df['Shooting'] = pd.to_numeric(merged_df['Shooting'], errors='coerce')
# Specify the positions you want to include
selected_positions = ['Point', 'Shooting', 'Small', 'Power', 'Center']

# Filter the DataFrame based on selected positions
filtered_df = merged_df[merged_df['position'].isin(selected_positions)]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='position', y='Shooting', data=filtered_df)
plt.title('Distribution of Players\' Shooting Percentages by Position')
plt.xlabel('Position')
plt.ylabel('Shooting Percentage')
plt.show()
```

4. Trends in Shooting Percentages Over the Years by Position
Analyzing shooting percentages over the years provides a historical perspective. The line plot below tracks shooting trends for different positions.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Convert 'Unnamed: 2_level_0' column to numeric
merged_df['Year'] = pd.to_numeric(merged_df['Unnamed: 2_level_0'], errors='coerce')

# Sort the DataFrame by the 'Year' column
merged_df = merged_df.sort_values('Year')

plt.figure(figsize=(25, 6))
ax = sns.lineplot(x='Year', y='Shooting.1', hue='position', data=merged_df)
plt.title('Trends in Shooting Percentages Over the Years by Position')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Shooting Percentage')

# Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45, ha='right')

plt.show()
```

5. Distribution of Players' Points Per Game by Position
Examining points per game is crucial for assessing offensive performance. A violin plot showcases the distribution of points per game for selected positions.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

merged_df['Per Game.1'] = pd.to_numeric(merged_df['Per Game.1'], errors='coerce')
# Specify the positions you want to include
selected_positions = ['Point', 'Shooting', 'Small', 'Power', 'Center']

# Filter the DataFrame based on selected positions
filtered_df = merged_df[merged_df['position'].isin(selected_positions)]

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.violinplot(x='position', y='Per Game.1', data=filtered_df)
plt.title('Distribution of Players\' Points Per Game by Position')
plt.xlabel('Position')
plt.ylabel('Points Per Game')
plt.show()
```

6. Average Free Throw Percentage by Position
The bar chart below displays the average free throw percentage for specific positions. It highlights differences in free throw performance.

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Convert 'Shooting.2' column to numeric
merged_df['Shooting.2'] = pd.to_numeric(merged_df['Shooting.2'], errors='coerce')

# Filter the DataFrame based on selected positions
selected_positions = ['Point', 'Shooting', 'Small', 'Power', 'Center']
filtered_avg_ft_percentage = avg_ft_percentage[avg_ft_percentage['position'].isin(selected_positions)]

# Create a bar graph
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='position', y='Shooting.2', data=filtered_avg_ft_percentage)
plt.title('Average Free Throw Percentage by Position')
plt.xlabel('Position')
plt.ylabel('Average Free Throw Percentage')

# Set y-axis limits and ticks with increments of 0.1
plt.ylim(0, 1)
plt.yticks([i/10 for i in range(11)])

plt.show()
```

Questions for Exploration
How has the distribution of player positions evolved over the years?
Are there correlations between shooting percentages and points per game?
How do shooting preferences vary across different player positions?
What trends can we observe in free throw percentages for specific positions?
Are there outliers in the data that significantly impact the overall statistics?
Conclusion
Basketball player analysis provides valuable insights into team dynamics, player performance, and strategic decision-making. By exploring various aspects of player statistics, we can uncover patterns, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make informed assessments that contribute to a deeper understanding of the game.
