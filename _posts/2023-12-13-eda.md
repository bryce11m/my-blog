# Introduction
Basketball is not just a sport; it's a dynamic, fast-paced game that involves skill, strategy, and teamwork. In this analysis, we delve into the world of basketball player statistics, exploring a dataset that combines information on player demographics, performance metrics, and shooting preferences.

# Motivation and Research Questions
Understanding player statistics is crucial for teams, coaches, and fans alike. How has shooting and efficiency changed over the years? How do shooting preferences vary among different positions? We aim to answer these questions and gain insights into the dynamics of basketball player performance.

 ## Questions for Exploration:
1. How has the distribution of player positions evolved over the years?
2. Are there correlations between shooting percentages and points per game?
3. How do shooting preferences vary across different player positions?
4. What trends can we observe in free throw percentages for specific positions?

# Data Collection and Cleaning
To conduct this analysis, we collected data from Basketball Reference, focusing on the Atlanta Hawks team. We merged two datasets, one containing player data and another detailing player positions and shooting preferences. After cleaning and merging the data, we created a comprehensive dataset for exploration.
